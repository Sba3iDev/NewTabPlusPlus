# Privacy Policy for NewTab++

**Last updated:** December 13, 2025

Thank you for using NewTab++, a browser extension designed to enhance your new tab page. This privacy policy outlines how your data is handled within the extension.

## Data We Store

NewTab++ stores the following information to provide its features:

*   **Shortcuts:** The list of websites you save as shortcuts on your new tab page.
*   **Search History:** A local history of terms you search for using the NewTab++ search bar to provide you with suggestions.
*   **Settings:** Your preferences for the extension, such as whether to show the clock, search bar, or shortcuts, and your background preferences.
*   **Uploaded Background Image:** If you choose to upload a custom background image, the image is stored locally in your browser's storage.

## How Your Data is Stored

All the data listed above is stored either **locally on your computer** using your browser's internal storage or synchronized across your devices using your browser's built-in sync functionality (e.g., Chrome Sync). **Your data is not stored on our servers.**

## Data Sharing with Third-Party Services

We do not sell or share your personal data with any third-party companies. However, to provide certain features, the extension communicates with the following services:

*   **Google Suggest:** When you type in the search bar, your query is sent to Google's suggestion service (`https://suggestqueries.google.com`) to provide you with search suggestions. This is the same service used by many browsers' search bars.
*   **Favicon Service:** To display icons for your shortcuts, the extension requests favicons from a third-party service (`https://favicon.im`). This service is only sent the hostname (e.g., "google.com") of the shortcut URL to retrieve the icon.

These services are essential for the extension's core functionality. We have chosen them for their reliability and have ensured that the data shared is limited to what is necessary.

## Use of Your Data

Your data is used solely to provide and improve the functionality of the NewTab++ extension. We do not use it for any other purpose, such as tracking you or showing you ads.

## No Additional Tracking

The extension does not include any third-party analytics or tracking codes.

## Donation Link

The extension includes an optional donation link in the settings panel that redirects to PayPal. This is a user-initiated action. If you choose to donate, you will be redirected to PayPal's website, which is governed by its own privacy policy.
